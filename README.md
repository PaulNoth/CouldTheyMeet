# CouldTheyMeet

Simple application that checks if two people could meet (theoretically) based on their birth and death dates. Persons are parsed from [DBpedia](http://data.dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/dbpedia/2014/en/persondata_en.ttl.bz2).

The purpose of this project is practicing Scala and related technologies.

Review is welcome!
